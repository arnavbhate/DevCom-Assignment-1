# My Portfolio Website

Written in only HTML and CSS. To run, just transfer all files to the root folder of a HTTP server or use the python `http.server` module by running `python -m http.server` on windows or `python3 -m http.server` on linux in the base directory.

I have implemented a responsive design and an auto dark mode with CSS as well as navigation using a top nav bar.
