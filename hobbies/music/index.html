      <h1>Music</h1>
      <p>
        Music for me is a stress-buster. I enjoy both listening to music and
        playing it. I like listening to western classical music, as well as to
        background music from movies and video games.

        I am a pianist and have completed Grade&nbsp;5 in Piano from Trinity
        College London. I have also completed Grade&nbsp;4 in Music Theory.
