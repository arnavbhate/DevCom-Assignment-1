      <h1>Astronomy</h1>
      <p>
        The universe has fascinated me since childhood. I enjoy stargazing with
        a telescope and like looking at photographs of astronomical objects.
        Astronomy is a fascinating science. We know so much about the universe
        just from observation. Astronomy is one of the few remaining fields of
        science where amateurs can make meaningful contributions towards the
        advancement of our knowledge.

        In the past, I had taken part in the Astronomy olympiad and attended the
        Orientation-cum-Selection Camp. At IIT Bombay, I actively take part in
        the activities of the Astronomy Club, Krittika.

        I have observed many celestial objects with telescopes. The list
        includes the sun, the moon, various planets and stars, as well as many
        star clusters, nebulae and galaxies. I have also performed observations
        at various dark sky sites.
